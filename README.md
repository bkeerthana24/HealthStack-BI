# HealthStack-BI
# Healthcare Insights Dashboard using Power BI

## Executive Summary
This project is an interactive healthcare analytics dashboard in Power BI to monitor patient admissions, treatment efficiency, and recovery outcomes. The dashboard integrates key performance indicators such as average cost per patient, recovery ratings, and diagnosis trends segmented by age group. Leveraging historical admission data, visual elements like line charts, bar graphs, and KPIs were used to identify high-risk diagnoses, optimize treatment planning, and reduce patient wait times.
